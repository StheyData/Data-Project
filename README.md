# Smokers Study Recreation with Pandas and Numpy

## Introduction

This Python Colab notebook serves as an educational and exploratory tool for recreating a specific study related to smokers. The study originally examined smoking behaviors, with statistical analysis of various attributes such as age, gender, and consumption habits. Our recreation will utilize the popular Python libraries, Pandas and Numpy, for data manipulation and analysis. 

## Prerequisites

Before starting with this Colab notebook, you should have:

1. Basic knowledge of Python programming.
2. Familiarity with the Pandas and Numpy libraries for Python.
3. Basic understanding of data analysis concepts and statistics.

## Setting up the Environment

As we are using a Colab notebook, most of the Python packages we'll be needing are pre-installed. However, make sure you have the following packages available:

- Pandas
- Numpy

If you're not sure whether these are installed or how to install them, you can run the following commands at the beginning of your notebook:

```python
!pip install pandas
!pip install numpy
```

## Data
The dataset utilized in this study is a recreation from the original smokers' study data. It is composed of various attributes such as age, gender, daily cigarette consumption, among others. It's important to note that to respect privacy and ethical standards, the dataset is free from any personally identifiable information.
